# Logging In Project

This is a Flutter + EdgeDB demo project that implements a basic login and registration flow.

Users can:
- Sign up with an email and password
- Log in using their credentials
- Switch between login and registration screens

User account data is stored in an EdgeDB database. Passwords are securely stored (hashed) â€” hash functionality will be implemented later using Go.

## ðŸ§± Technologies Used

- Flutter & Dart (frontend)
- EdgeDB (database)
- GitHub (version control)
